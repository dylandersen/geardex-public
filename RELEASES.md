# GearDex macOS Release Channels

This repository hosts official GearDex macOS app releases. It also serves as the public issue tracker for both the web app and macOS app.

## Channel Definitions

- Stable: production-ready macOS builds
- Pre-release: early access macOS builds for testing and feedback

Note: the web app at [www.geardex.app](https://www.geardex.app) does not have downloadable release artifacts, but web issues should still be reported in this repository.

## Version Labels

Example:

- `v1.2.0` = stable release
- `v1.3.0-beta.1` = pre-release

## Pre-release Guidance

- Pre-releases may contain unfinished changes.
- Keep backups of important data before testing pre-releases.
- Report pre-release issues with steps to reproduce and version details.

## Upgrade Checklist

- Backup: Back up any important local data before installing a new macOS build.
- Known risks: Read release notes for known issues and migration notes before upgrading.
- Rollback path: If an upgrade causes problems, reinstall the previous stable version from the Releases page and report the issue with both version numbers.
